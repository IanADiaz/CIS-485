You still need one more restful API:
    - GET
    - PUT
    - POST
    - DELETE
^^^Possible Ideas:
    - GET the chat room
    - PUT their messages 
    - POST new messages
    - DELETE their messages
^^Above has been verrified

reinforce new chat routes with authentication and authorization!
^^^Im pretty sure i already did this with the use of js tokens
